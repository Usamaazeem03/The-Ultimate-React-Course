# 🌤️ Classy Weather

A small weather application built using **React Class Components** to understand and practice **old React codebases and lifecycle methods**.

This project was not built to learn something new.
It was built to **understand how legacy React applications work**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

Modern React uses hooks and function components.
But many real-world projects still use **class components**.

The goal of this project was to:

- Learn how **old React codebases** are structured
- Understand **class component lifecycle methods**
- Practice reading and writing **non-hook React code**
- Build confidence in working with **legacy React projects**

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

While building this project, I learned:

- How `componentDidMount` works (similar to `useEffect(..., [])`)
- How `componentDidUpdate` replaces dependency-based effects
- How state is managed in class components using `this.setState`
- How side effects are handled without hooks
- How different the **mental model** of class components is compared to hooks
- How to **read and understand old code**, not just write new code

## 🛠️ Features

- Search weather by city name
- Uses Open-Meteo API for:

  - Geocoding
  - Weather forecast

- Saves last searched location in `localStorage`
- Shows:

  - Daily min & max temperature
  - Weather condition icons

- Built **entirely using class components**

## 🚀 Why This Matters

> Real companies don’t always use the latest syntax.
> They use code that works.

Understanding old codebases is a **real professional skill**.

This project helped me move from:

> “I know React”
> to
> “I can understand React code written by others.”
