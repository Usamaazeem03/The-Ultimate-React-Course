// Summary
1_Components : Components are the building blocks of any user interFace (UI) in React.
               Each components is a self-contained piece of the user interface,which incluudes its own data own logic and own appearance this appearance using a declarative syntax that called JSX. 

2_JSX : JSX is what's going to describe exactly what the user will see on the screen ehen they use the app.
        Any piece of JSX can contain som markup, in form of HTML ant also contain some CSS or JAvaScript.
           
3_Props : Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from one component to another in React.
          They make components reusable by allowing you to customize them with different values.
          Props work just like function parameters, and the receiving component uses them with {}.

4_Rendering : Rendering means showing the UI on the screen based on the JSX written in the component.
              Whenever something changes in the component (like state or props), React automatically re-renders the UI to keep it updated.
              Rendering is what turns your code (JSX) into something the user can actually see and interact with.

5_Conditionally Render Components : Conditional rendering means showing or hiding components based on a certain condition.
                                    In React, you can use JavaScript conditions (like if, else, or the ? : operator) inside JSX to decide what to display.
                                    This makes the UI more dynamic and responsive to changes
