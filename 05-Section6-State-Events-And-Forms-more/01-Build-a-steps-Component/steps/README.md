# 🧭 React Steps App

This is a simple **React project** built as part of my course learning journey.
The app demonstrates how to manage **state**, use **React hooks** like `useState`, and create a simple **multi-step progress interface**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Step-by-step navigation (1 → 3)
- ✅ Dynamic message updates for each step
- ✅ Open/close toggle for the step component
- ✅ Clean UI with active step highlighting
- ✅ Demonstrates the use of React Hooks (`useState`)

---

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- **React.js** (Functional Components + Hooks)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **CSS** for basic styling

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. The app shows **three steps**:

   - Step 1 → “Learn React ⚛️”
   - Step 2 → “Apply for jobs 💼”
   - Step 3 → “Invest your new income 🤑”

2. The user can move between steps using **Previous** and **Next** buttons.
3. The **Close (×)** button toggles visibility of the step section.
4. State management is handled using `useState`.
