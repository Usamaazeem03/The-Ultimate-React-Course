// STATE
_Interal data, owned by component
_Component "menory"
_can be updated by the component itself
_Updating state causes component to re-render
_Used to make components interactive

_Receiving new props causes component to re-render usually when parents state has updated
_Used by parent to configure child component ("setting")
