// Deriving State
_State that is computed form an existing piece of state or from props

Bad Code:
const [cart, setCart] = useState([
  {item: "water bottel", price: 50},
  {item: "milk bottel", price: 150},
])
const [numItem, setNumItem] = useState(2)
const [totalPrice, setTotalPrice] = useState(200)

👎 Three separate pieces of state, even though numitems and totalPrice depend on card
👎 Need to keep the is sync (update together)
👎 3 state updates will cause 3 re-renders

Good Code:
const [cart, setCart] = useState([
  {item: "water bottel", price: 50},
  {item: "milk bottel", price: 150},
])
const numItem = cart.length;
const totalPrice =cart.renduce((acc, cur)=> acc + cur.price, 0);

👍 Just reguar variables, no useState
👍 Cart state is the single source of truth for this related dta
👍 Works because re-rendering component will automatically re-calculate derived state
